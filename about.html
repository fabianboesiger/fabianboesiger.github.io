        I'm a software engineer focusing on building secure and reliable systems with a master's student in computer science at ETH Zürich.
        Besides computer science, I'm interested in economics, politics and astrophotography.

        <h3>Application Engineer at Schindler</h3>
        <p>
            While completing my master's studies at ETH, I began working part-time as an application engineer at Schindler Berufsbildung,
            where I had the chance to contribute to existing projects and build my own projects from scratch.

            During my studies at ETH Zürich, I worked on various open-source projects.
            These projects and the excellent education at ETH helped push my programming skills to an advanced level.

        <h3>MSc ETH in Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            After finishing the bachelor's degree in computer science,
            I continued studying for the master's degree with a major in
            the field of secure and reliable systems and a minor in networking.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wrote my <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/Fabian_Boesiger_MS_Thesis.pdf">master's thesis</a> in the area of program synthesis.

        <h3>BSc ETH in Computer Science</h3>
        <p>
            I started studying computer science at ETH Zürich due to the passion for programming
            that I developed in the introductory courses for computer science at the Kantonsschule Sursee. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During my bachelor's studies, my interest in building reliable software began to grow.
            This motivated me to learn the Rust programming language in 2019 and influenced my selection of the major for
            my master's studies. I also wrote my
            <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/chair-program-method/pm/documents/Education/Theses/Fabian_Boesiger_BS_Report.pdf">bachelor's thesis</a> in the field of program verification.

        <h3>Kantonsschule Sursee</h3>
        <p>
            My educational career began at the Kantonsschule Sursee.
            Here, I acquired a fundamental knowledge base for which I'm very thankful today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The introductory computer science courses sparked my interest in programming,
            and my focus on mathematics and physics provided me with the necessary mathematical and logical intuition for studying computer science.
            For my <a href="https://kssursee.lu.ch/-/media/KSSursee/Dokumente/sb/HallOfFame/AusgezeichneteArbeiten/MA17_GHE_Boesiger_Fabian_6B.pdf?la=de-CH">Maturaarbeit</a>,
            I implemented a neural network for facial recognition from scratch.
