The Russian military has adopted a strategy of attrition in the Ukraine War. We show this by analyzing equipment losses from the Russian[^1] and Ukrainian[^2] sides.

We use open-source intelligence data on equipment losses gathered from publicly available sources. The data only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment for which photo or videographic evidence is available. We categorize this data into *Aircraft*, *Drones* (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), *Infantry Vehicles* (Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Infantry Mobility Vehicles), *Armoured Vehicles* (Tanks, Armoured Fighting Vehicles) and *Artillery* (Self-Propelled Artillery, Towed Artillery, Multiple Rocket Launch Systems).

During the first days of the war, the Russian army was advancing towards Ukaine's capital Kyiv from three sides. We can see that Russia suffered large losses of infantry vehicles and armored vehicles during this period, eventually forcing them back to regroup and focus on their attack from the southern and eastern front. We can also clearly see that the Russian military never was able to achieve air supremacy. Achieving air supremacy is vital for a fast-moving war and a quick victory.

On 21 September 2022, Russia declared a partial mobilization. This allowed Russia to better occupy its front lines and avoid further breakthroughs. After this partial mobilization, around day 200 in the plot, we can see an increase in Russian equipment losses, in particular infantry vehicles, armoured vehicles and artillery. This marks a change in strategy for the Russian military from a fast-paced war to a war of attrition. Although the Russian side suffers more losses than the Ukrainian size, the Russian military is much larger than the Ukrainian one and they can continue mobilizing millions of soldiers, while the Ukrainian side is already fully mobilized.

To summarize, we can see from the data how Russia's fast advance toward Ukraine's capital didn't work out and how they didn't achieve air supremacy. Now the Russian military is playing out its main advantage, which is its sheer size, to slowly tear down and exhaust the Urkainian military.
