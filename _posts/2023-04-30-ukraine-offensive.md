Last week, it was reported that the promised 230 western tanks and 1550 armored vehicles had all arrived in Ukraine. Furthermore, in the same week, the Russian Black Sea Fleet was attacked in the port of Sevastopol by kamikaze drones. Another drone strike destroyed an oil depot in Sevastopol. Finally, four S-300 anti-air missile systems and an anti-aircraft-gun tank Gepard were spotted in Promin, Mykolajiv. All of these events indicate an imminent attack in that area.

*An overview of the recent events and predicted movements.*

The attack will most likely occur along the two highways E97 and E105 where tanks can move fast. With an attack on Crimea, the main goals will be securing the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch bridge that connects Crimea with Russia. If Crima can be successfully liberated from Russian occupation, the next step will most likely be to advance east towards Mariupol.
